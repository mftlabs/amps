# Data Configuration

The **Data Configuration** section of AMPS contains all the fields pertinent to managing data across environments. The following fields are not environment-specific, and rather are global across all environments. Each field and a brief description of each are listed below.

- [Providers](providers.md): Providers contain the configuration and credentials for connecting to various external services.
- [Environments](environments.md): Environments are independent, namespaced environments in which messaging workflows can be created and exported as Demos.
- [Demos](demos.md): Demos are an importable snapshot of Message Configuration entities that generally serve to represent a particular messaging workflow.
