# Routing Rules

Routing Rules are part of Router Actions and allow for messages to be sent to specific based on Match Patterns that test message metadata against configured glob or regex patterns. When all Match Patterns are matched, a routing rule is executed and the message is routed to the corresponding output topic. The fields for Routing Rules are described below.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Output Topic\*   | The topic to route the message to if all match patterns are matched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Match Patterns\* | A list of patterns to use when determining whether a Routing Rule should be executed. A match pattern consists of a Field, which can be either an AMPS-defined metadata field or a custom metadata field, a Regex flag indicating whether the pattern is using glob (by default) or regex, and a Pattern which will matched against the corresponding metadata value of incoming messages. |
