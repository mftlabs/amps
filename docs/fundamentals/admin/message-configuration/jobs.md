# Jobs

Jobs refer to the scheduled delivery of messages to a specific topic in order to trigger message workflows. For example, if a subscriber listens on topic "amps.actions.runscript.cleanup" to run a script that should perform a cleanup action every 30 minutes, a job would be created using a "timer" Job Type, to execute every 30 minutes and send a message to "amps.actions.runscript.cleanup" with any additional metadata. The fields for defining jobs are specified below.
