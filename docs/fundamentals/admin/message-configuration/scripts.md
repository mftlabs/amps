# Scripts

The scripts screen is a convenient way to manage Python scripts you are using in AMPS. The script screen has two sections, Editor and Packages, which are described below.

## Editor

The editor screen lists all scripts and their sizes for the current environment. Double-clicking a script opens it in the editor where it can be edited as necessary and saved using CMD or CTRL + S. The editor has Intellisense and Autocompletion for python packages. New scripts can be created using the plus button next to the grid. When creating a script, a script template can be specified, or a minimal script can be created. Additional, the script list can be refreshed using the refresh button.

## Packages

The packages screen lists all Python packages currently installed on the server and available to use in Python scripts. Scripts can be filtered using the filter text input at the top of the grid which automatically filters the grid as you type. New packages can be installed using the plus button to the right of the grid. Additionally, the list can be refreshed using refresh button.
