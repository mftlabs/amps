# Actions

Actions are performed both to transform received messages, and also to receive messages. AMPS comes built in with a variety of actions for convenience, however, for additional functionality, the Run Script action allows for full freedom in writing scripts to perform any action on a message or retrieving data from any source. The various actions and their fields are specified below.

## Common Fields

This section describes fields that appear in all or many different actions. Required field are denoted with a \*
