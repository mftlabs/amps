# Templates

Templates are Python scripts that serve as starting points for creating new Python scripts. Their intention is to simplify the creation of scripts that may be more complex and share logic or structure. Additionally, they can serve as a collaborative tool for AMPS users to share script templates amongst one another to increase overall functionality. The fields are listed below.
