# Universe File Agent

Universe File Agent (UFA) is an original MFTLabs file transfer solution. UFA Agents are user-associated services installed on machines in order to perform upload operations from the file system and download operations from mailbox topics based on configured UFA Agent Rules. UFA Agents authenticate against AMPS using User [Auth Tokens](tokens.md), which can be revoked at any time.

Once started, agent configuration and rule creation, update, and deletion are all administered by the AMPS UI, both from the Admin Portal and from the User Portal. Agents poll AMPS at a configured interval to receive configuration and agent rule updates. Additionally, UFA Logs are available in both the Admin and User Portals, displaying agent rule logs, heartbeat logs, and configuration update logs.

To download a UFA Agent, a User can sign in to the User Portal and specify the operating system, the Architecture Type (64-bit or 32-bit), and an auth token to use to authenticate the user on the agent.

The fields for agent configuration as well as agent upload and download are provided below along with their descriptions.

| [Download]-Consumer Config      | This section configures the corresponding consumer that will the UFA Agent will use to fetch messages for this particular rule. Mailbox specifies the mailbox from which to fetch messages. (The mailbox topic is automatically generated and displayed based on the mailbox chosen) Deliver policy indicates how messages should be received from this mailbox topic on creation. All indicates that the subscriber will receive all messages that have been sent to this topic starting with the earliest message. New indicates that the subscriber will receives all new messages sent to the topic after the creation of the consumer. Last indicates that the subscriber will receive all messages that have been sent to this topic starting with the most recent message. Start Time indicates that the subscriber will receive messages sent to this topic after a specific start time. Updating any configuration in the Consumer Config results in a new consumer being created with the given configuration. For this reason, if it is important to only consumer messages after a certain point, use Start Time as it remains the same on all consumer config updates. |
